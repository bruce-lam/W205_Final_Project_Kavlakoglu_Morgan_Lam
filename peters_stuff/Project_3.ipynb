First, we need to change into the w205 directory and clone the project repository. This is done using the commands below.\n","\n","```console\n","cd ~/w205\n","git clone https://github.com/mids-w205-martin-mims/project-3-superpeter55.git\n","```\n","\n","Next, we must move into our new directory and create a new branch \"assignemnt\" and switch over to that branch. This is done using the commands below. We also include the git status command and its output to ensure that we are on the assignment branch as expected. As you can see, we successfully created and switched to the assignment branch\n","\n","```console\n","cd project-3-superpeter55\n","git branch assignment\n","git checkout assignment\n","git status\n","```\n","```console\n","On branch assignment\n","```\n","\n","The next step is going to be copying our docker-compose file from the week 13 content so we can run our docker images. This is done using the command below. In this case, the period \".\" at the end of the command pastes the copied file in the current directory. Once this is copied in, there are a few changes we have to make to ensure our docker containers run properly. First, we must comment out the two lines in the cloudera service that read \"ports:\" and \"8888:8888\". These lines are already commented out in the spark service in the docker-compose file and must be uncommented. This insures that we can run a jupyter notebook with pyspark in port 8888.\n","\n","```console\n","cp ~/w205/course-content/13-Understanding-Data/docker-compose.yml .\n","```\n","\n","Now that we have copied in the docker-compose file and made the necessary modifications, we will spin up our cluster using the command below. The -d at the end runs the containers in the background and we are able to continue to use our console. Next we will use docker-compose ps to make sure all the containers are up. The command lists all the containers and some basic information on them. Since all the containers say they are in the state \"up\", we will proceed.\n","\n","```console\n","docker-compose up -d\n","```\n","\n","Now that our cluster is running, we will create our kafka topic. We will use the exec command on kafka to execute a single kafka command. In this case we run the kafka-topics command with the --create option to create a topic. The --topic option is used to name the topic \"events\". I chose to name this topic events because we are collecting game event data for this project. We use the --partitions option to specify that we only need one partition. The --if-not-exists option is to prevent two topics with the same name being created. The --zookeeper option is specifying which port we would like to connect our topic to. To ensure this command is successful, the console will output \"Created topic events\".\n","\n","```console\n","docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --create --topic events --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --if-not-exists --zookeeper zookeeper:32181\n","```\n","\n","Moving on we will set up the game_api.py file which will define what type of events we can perform. To start, we will copy the game_api.py file from week 12 and then make some modifications. This is done using the command below.\n","\n","```console\n","cp ~/w205/course-content/12-Querying-Data-II/game_api.py .\n","```\n","\n","The game_api.py file from week 12 does not have functions for buy a sword or join guild so we will need to create them. Some neat functions of this project are that we give the user the option to buy a sword or buy a sharp sword. We also have 3 guilds the user can join to represent each team member on this project. There is the Morgan guild, the Lam guild, and the Kavlakoglu guild. There are separate events for each of these guilds which will join that specific guild while the generic join_guild event will randomly select a guild to join.\n","\n","The functions added to the game_api.py file are shown below. These functions are very similar to the function that already exists in the game_api.py file named purchase_a_sword(). The first line of each function specifies the path that will need to be specified to trigger each event. In this case, we are specifying /buy_a_sword or /purchase_a_sharp_sword to trigger the a buy sword event. To join a guild, we specify /join_guild to join a random guild or the specific guild paths to choose which guild to join. Each of these functions defines a dictionary of metadata. All events have an event type. For buy_sword events, we specify the sword_type which is either normal or sharp. For join_guild events, we specify the guild_name, and the assignment_type which says if the guild was joined randomly or if we chose which guild we were joining. The log_to_kafka step sends the event and event metadata to the kafka topic \"events\". Finally the return statement returns a nice message to the user that tells them what happened. \n","\n","```python\n","@app.route(\"/buy_a_sword\")\n","def buy_a_sword():\n","    buy_sword_event = {'event_type': 'buy_sword',\n","                       'sword_type': 'normal'}\n","    log_to_kafka('events', buy_sword_event)\n","    return \"Sword Bought!\\n\"\n","\n","@app.route(\"/join_guild\")\n","def join_guild():\n","    guilds = ['Morgan','Lam','Kavlakoglu']\n","    guild = random.choice(guilds)\n","    join_guild_event = {'event_type': 'join_guild',\n","                        'guild_name': guild,\n","                        'assignment_type': 'random'}\n","    log_to_kafka('events', join_guild_event)\n","    return \"Joined \" + guild + \" Guild!\\n\"\n","\n","@app.route(\"/purchase_a_sharp_sword\")\n","def purchase_a_sharp_sword():\n","    purchase_sword_event = {'event_type': 'buy_sword',\n","                            'sword_type': 'sharp'}\n","    log_to_kafka('events', purchase_sword_event)\n","    return \"Sharp Sword Purchased!\\n\"\n","\n","@app.route(\"/join_guild_morgan\")\n","def join_guild_morgan():\n","    join_guild_event = {'event_type': 'join_guild',\n","                        'guild_name': 'Morgan',\n","                        'assignment_type': 'manual'}\n","    log_to_kafka('events', join_guild_event)\n","    return \"Joined Morgan Guild!\\n\"\n","\n","@app.route(\"/join_guild_lam\")\n","def join_guild_lam():\n","    join_guild_event = {'event_type': 'join_guild',\n","                        'guild_name': 'Lam',\n","                        'assignment_type': 'manual'}\n","    log_to_kafka('events', join_guild_event)\n","    return \"Joined Lam Guild!\\n\"\n","\n","@app.route(\"/join_guild_kavlakoglu\")\n","def join_guild_kavlakoglu():\n","    join_guild_event = {'event_type': 'join_guild',\n","                        'guild_name': 'Kavlakoglu',\n","                        'assignment_type': 'manual'}\n","    log_to_kafka('events', join_guild_event)\n","    return \"Joined Kavlakoglu Guild!\\n\"\n","```\n","\n","Now that we have updated our game_api.py file, we can run our flask app through the game_api.py file.
